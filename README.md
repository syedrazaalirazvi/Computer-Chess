# Computer-Chess

Version 2021.3.21.001
  *This version includes saving all the units of White and Black players in a two-dimensional array (data-type: char) and also printing them on a board.
  *The board is created using the special characters "|" and "_".
  *All the empty positions on the board are stored in the corresponding Array Location as Null Characters('\0').
  *While displaying the chess board all the Empty positions (i.e, all Null Elements in the array) are represented as Whitespaces. 
  *The White player units are represented with Upper-Case letters.
  *The Black player units are represented with Lower-Case letters.
